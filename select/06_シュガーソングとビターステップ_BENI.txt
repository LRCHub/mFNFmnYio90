We get so numb to all the catastrophic madness
Finding peace somehow turn the insanity around
A rumbling coaster swerving left right up and down
The blurry vision all becomes so clear now

Nowadays we try so hard to represent 'equality'
Our hearts become an extra like an 'etc.'
Cut the strings let it go
We won't let them hold us down
It's ok to say what's on your mind

Oh people walking by in the city through the night
Some are smiling while the others are
So lonely living in the dark
A world so black and white
Let's write a beautiful melody
You're the key and I'm the rhythm

Marmalade and a sugar song, peanuts and a bitter step
So bittersweet it's spinning me around and round
I'm falling down
Headed for the south west, keep the party going on
'Cause this'll be the night that
The whole world will see us shine
Oh I feel so fly spreading light
Illuminate from my reflector

We get so trapped inside what's logical or illogical
Feels like even music's become disposable
You can hate, you can love, but don't ever give it up
Even if we're different it's alright

Ah, when the record stops and when it's all said and done
Some are smiling while the others are
So lonely crying in the dark
We're all one in the same
But when the words come pouring out
It all leads to misunderstanding

Playing back that sugar song, happiness with bitter step
We're searching for a reason not to go and throw it all away
Never look back never regret 'cause tomorrow's straight ahead
Update your cloudy mind weather the storm until we shine
Now watch me shine

Someday, after all the madness fades away and
Someday, and what's right or wrong won't mean a thing
Just feel the song and step
And play the music on and on and on and on
To show them who we really are 'cause
That's the way we gotta prove it now, QED

Marmalade and sugar song, peanuts and bitter step
We're searching for a reason to live like it was our last day
Left behind the north east
Looking back how far we've come
'Cause this'll be the night that the whole world will see us shine

Marmalade and a sugar song, peanuts and a bitter step
So bittersweet it's spinning me around and round
I'm falling down
Headed for the south west, keep the party going on
'Cause this'll be the night that
The whole world will see us shine
Oh I feel so fly spreading light
Illuminate from my reflector

With good comes bad
With the bad comes the good
But life goes on
